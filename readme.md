### ðŸ“ŒProject Overview
This SQL project performs ABC analysis on product inventory to classify items based on their revenue contribution. It includes:

- Product value calculations (total units sold, revenue, % of total value)

- ABC classification (A = top 80%, B = next 15%, C = remaining 5%)

- Inventory metrics (count, total stock, average inventory per class)
- Turnover ratio (how quickly products sell relative to stock levels)


### ðŸš€ Potential Improvements
- Incorporate time-based trends (monthly/quarterly ABC shifts).

- Visualize results in Power BI/Tableau for business reporting.

### ðŸ“‚ File Details
- ðŸ“„ query_abc.sql â€“ Contains all SQL queries for ABC classification and inventory analysis.

- ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Helps businesses optimize stock levels, prioritize high-value items, and improve supply chain efficiency.
